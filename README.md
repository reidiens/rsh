# tsh - the toledo shell

A very simple shell made to teach myself about how the shell works.

To build, simply run make and execute with `./tsh` By default, neofetch opens automatically when the shell is started. To not have this happen, comment out the first 2 lines of the function `tsh_init()` in the file `tsh_core.c`. Save, then build again.
